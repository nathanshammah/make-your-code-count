# 7 - Publishing Your Results


## 7.1 - Publish peer-reviewed research papers that use the library
This is probably the standard output that scientists as physicists have been aiming at even before the advent of open-source software development.
This is still one of the main markers in academic activity.

## 7.2 - Upload the library or dataset on Zenodo
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is a service that allows to publish code, a dataset or a full-fledged library, on an online repository that anyone can access.
Zenodo was a project started at CERN with the backing of the European Union and now its use fall perfectly in line with open data policies, such OpenAIRE and EOSC.

You can set up Zenodo with a switch directly from the GitHub page of your repository.

Zenodo offers a two-fold opportunity:

For the researchers who developed the code, it provides instantaneously a DOI reference.
The arXiv currently does not provide such bibliographic identifier.
This is useful to protect claims of a discovery or research idea, as a code might not end up in a research paper.

For the research community and especially for referees of a paper related to the library and/or dataset, it provides a crystallization of the version release.
This can help check that a given tool does what it claimed to do at the time of submission.
In this way, reproducibility of results is made easier.

## 7.3 - Present the library in a peer-reviewed research paper
There are now multiple outlets that are tailored to present software packages that are related to research.
A classic one is Computer Physics Communications.

In physics and quantum physics in particular there are several alternative options (for more details on open-source libraries in quantum technology, see
"The rise of open source in quantum physics research" [blog post](http://blogs.nature.com/onyourwavelength/2019/01/09/the-rise-of-open-source-in-quantum-physics-research/).
):

- [SciPost](https://scipost.org/) journals such as SciPost Physics, which cover all physics, with a focus on condensed-matter applications.
The papers of the QuSpin library have been published there.

- [Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/), a community-driven journal that has already published papers on the ProjectQ and other quantum tech projects.

- PLOS One, which established a [special collection](https://collections.plos.org/open-quantum) focusing on quantum software.

- [Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/about/) is a revolutionary project that aims at coalescing interactive features into a modern article format.

- [The Journal of Open Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/) is an open access journal for research software packages; the review process happens on GitHub.
